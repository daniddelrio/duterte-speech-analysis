presidential anticorruption commission fellow workers in government other distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen let me relate to you or narrate two events which happened during the last four mounts the first was a command conference of all armed forces and police officers on that day i was quite busy dismantling the board of and without any public bidding and as everybody knows i have always stressed bidding that is fair and just wala ho silang bidding and on top of that is the nayong pilipino and they contract with a gambling casino in that area and so i was not really feeling great when i arrived here for the in this room for the command conference i sonny dominguez passed many many a complaint about medicines purchases by the afp hospital for the soldiers and that there were some ghost deliveries in that file they gave me so i just lost my patience and i told the military and the police i am really very sad because kayo pa naman ang pinagkatiwalaan ko to cover my back and here you are this paying none for the soldiers sabi ko you you you can f*** with was really for the soldiers and so in my exasperation i said you know i am really very tired i think my mindset now cannot absorb so much for all of this and so i said i would like to offer to you my resignation if the four branches of the armed forces and the police albayalde was there if you would stand up all of you then that is an indication that you want another president then i will step down tonight and so nobody stood up and so we just i let it pass and well i said i a delivery which never came it concerned an office in the dar department of agrarian reforms and all my cabinet was there present and there was this complaint that some of those applications for conversion came in in almost two to three years so i told castriciones maggawaan mo ako ng simplified during the cabinet meeting because if i find it good then i can suggest the other departments to follow and when he started to show it though not his fault really i am not blaming him but the way the bureaucracy is set up it is really conducive to or for corruption to thr you would need a radical change overnight if you want corruption to stop so i proceeded about four pages full of requirements clearance from the nib clearance from waterworks clearance from the lgus nako patay na tapos clearance and clearance he was talking i stoop up and i said that documents that you are suggesting to make things faster is not for me it belongs to two about two presidents from now with those requirements you will ensure corruption and it would come naturally and automatic kung ganun karaming clearances magkuha ng clearance sa waterworks magkuha ka ng clearance sa practically in all ang wala doon ang foreign affairs lang laughter listening to you because that is not my concern it cannot work on me so i stood up and i said sinabi nandiyan sila roy sinabi ko sa kanila want exaltations or whatever i just want simply to resign and rest at pagtindig ko sinabi ko because most of my number of retired military officers and the civilians parang almost hati na tapos doon na ako sa labas well of course castriciones proceeded to rattle ahead with the executive secretary and maybe invite some guys from the agree on certain procedures kasi kung anoano na lang rin ang pinaglalagay kasi iyong regulations nila nagpatong doon sa they add more and more regulations and it dito nagit could not really be corruption but it could be shortsightedness or plain i will not follow that because that is stupid ganun eh regulation then you are hailed to the sandiganbayan for gross violation of regulations you know you are not congress it is only congress who can mete out imprisonments by law katok laughter they are lost in a maze of so many requirements some are really stupid who is this guy before the end of the year i will just suggest and if it is accepted by all fine then at the end of the year they would say that you have to you have to reimburse government eh p***** i** nagastos ko na saan ako maghanap sandigan kasi ito sila at noon if you want to buy computers on the local level you have to go to manila for permission i do not really see the rationale of these requirements but some stupid enterprising guys would just come up and to make money what for kasi pupunta pa kami dito get those requirements and you have to spend money following up considering the monster of traffic that you have to deal with now they wanted us to buy a computer that was something like a piece itong akin naman it was sold by a korean ganun rin puro made in ano mo so i did not so i proceeded but then on the other hand the lawyer and me says that well mukhang magkocomprise na lang siguro but i signed the contract pero nawithdraw ko alam mo idenemanda ako ng coa and the guy there sa sandi the ombudsman went back and forth and to think that he had the gall to ask me to pay for his hotel bills and all ikaw naman pagka gusto mo sila ang mga ano ko sabi ko ayaw ko kung magbayad ako sa hotel nila p***** i** papatayin ko laughter niyan there will be a crescendo of complaints pero but after that three well anyway i they it was filed with the sandigan i filed the motion to dismiss the garbled to evidence denied i went to the supreme court i was acquitted both on procedural and substantial issues kaya hindi nila alam i was i became president i experienced it all kaya huwag mo akong p***** i***** yayariin kita laughter hindi ako nagyayabang i was mayor for years i was a congressman for one term then i became iyan ang ikulong laughter then i went back to being nako diyos ko and the other one itong coa from every year nagpapaparty ako so i have a day during december for the blind people they have a night then the following night then we have the differently abled just to be look as long as the webster dictionary says it is disabled then they should be called disabled huwag na natin pagandahin iyang miserable diyan you bring to fore their situation and mahighlight tuloy ang arrest magpunta ng pupunta ng bar pupunta ng kung ano mga buang kasi laughter hindi ang condition that they are supervised by the city health officer icewomen na hindi if only if the city health officer would request for the police to intervene otherwise sabi ko sa kanila if you go to the city health officer you have this attendance card and you use condom fine with me sige you work the whole night if you enjoy it iyon lang walang walang vice squad vice squad eh in all of my years as a student of law and as a lawyer and as president i have yet to hear a single prostitute being prosecuted in court for exercising tapos igood time tapos binubugbog pa iyan ang ayaw ko so i decided altogether do not because if you do that may bugbog ka sa akin nangbganon time corruption ang problema nito every table diyan sa opisina ayaw kong magmention kasi lahat finofollow up ka basta clearance basta clearance or a certification from this office they simply sit on it at pabalik kaya ngayon ganito i have announced it then and now that anybody who has a complaint for itong mga

mabilog laughter tas magtanong siya kay diyan sa mga security sin of secretary drilon magpunta ka ng iloilo saan earn that much in so short a time how much is your salary kagaya si parojinog mayor of ozamiz you know if you are from ozamiz or you guys have been there ang ozamiz city is appears to be calm a there wala namang ano wala namang hunger o ano kaya pala lahat ng mga tagaozamiz natuto ng maging courier kuha sila ng supply doon ipagbili nila sa ibang lugar kaya karamihang nahuhuli puro taga this is really the meat of my the corruption so he was so rich that he could afford to kill two of his policemen no four pero hindi man nakita killing him tapos dalawang mig sa armed forces na intelligence until now hindi namin makita so ang power pumasok na talaga sa ulo niya and he has a house thing to see he had to go never never allow any soldier or police to go to prison for doing his duty i will not allow that sabi ko sige lang odicta the couple were killed in a sa pier were the ones do sila si mayor iyong mayor na malibog na hindi na umuwi dito sa right side it was espinosa the mayor who was killed while he was inside the detention cell when it was opened he tried to kill the policeman so there was a shootout ganun but whether true or not they will have my support hindi ko sila pababayaan talaga i will not abandon any sold ang pinaka delikado sa lahat sa atin the most dangerous the one dangerous thing is drugs i'm sure almost everybody of you listened to the presidential debates early on and you i know that you could maybe probably remember that i said a few words because of the very constrictive time given us to talk about our program bigyan ka lang ng one minute and seconds of what things can you kaya ako bullet nang bullet lang short lang ako wala na ako one was corruption second sabi ko drugs the third is corruption in the bureaucracy and fourth that i would try to look for money remember i never used the words build build build ireview ninyo 'yung tapes i never said it because i was not sure where would i go at that time i knew that china was really very angry at the behavior of the previous administration so hindi ko malaman so i never promised any grand or whatever so i just kept low and it was not because of that reason when i was there already 'yung intelligence ng or everybody the intelligence community warned me that there is something a brewing there in marawi they were passing arms openly and i thought that i needed more arms because the ones are really very old they are not accurate anymore a rifle is only good for rounds after that loose na 'yung bore malaki na paglabas ng bala wala ng direksyon sumasayaw na eh because there is that they have its own trajectory ang susunod umiikot 'yan because there is that rifling tawag nila so paglabas niyan umiikot 'yan sa may thousands every minute eh wala na handmedown 'yung sa pulis they get it from the army na talagang panahon pa ni marcos 'yung iba so i was a quandary i wanted to buy so i ordered from america ngayon bigla na lang nagsabi that ang america sabi ng mga congressman pati senador doon they took the floor to denounce me for my human rights violation daw so they refused to deliver what a cruel thing to do alam nila because i know that the americans are very very active sa intelligence and they know the situation ayaw nilang ibigay so i went to i sent word to china that i want to visit mr xi jinping so i went there i talked to the ambassador and i was received there i realized that we can talk things over and we can be in good stead again so sinabi kong problema ko sabi ni xi jinping it's ok i know your problem arms we'll give you the arms free napanganga ako sabi ko kasi i want to buy arms from you but i do not have any money right now could i just have a easy schedule for payment ah sabi niya you can have it so gusto ko nang marami kulang pa rin i went to russia sabi ni president putin oh we'll give it to you it was on that visit sa russia pumutok 'yung kaya talaga ako nag sentimiyento sa mga amerikano tapos nagpabili sila ng huey canada and look they told me that we will give you the helicopters but you cannot arm them you cannot place arm because you cannot use this against you own citizen sabi ko f*** you guys my own citizens are revolting trying to oust me out of office killing my soldiers and policemen and karamihan pinakamarami namamatay ngayon is barangay captains those who would opt to be sympathetic with the government 'yung ayaw nila pinapatay talaga nila sabi ko these communists they are my citizens right but they are walang ano i survived with a and to tell you frankly the rifle the sniper rifle sniper is used when your target is way way ahead very far the rifle that killed hapilon was a chinese made rifle sniper rifle and it was given to me in a glass case ng mga sundalo 'yun ang istorya diyan now itong ang corruption meron rin pero not so much dito sa military and even the police ang malaki dito 'yung mga mayaman the filthy rich sila 'yung mga may rebates sa kanilang taxes and if you will review them like the lopez's marcos was overthrown cory gave him back abscbn to rehabilitate abscbn oh anong ginawa niyo where did they get the money they borrowed from dbp ang dbp noon sikat eh noong naghiram tapos hindi nabayaran believe me these are government records they did not pay the dbp kaya ang dbp bumagsak and worst of all they condoned the utang 'yan ang masakit kaya ako kritikal diyan sa abscbn kaya ko pinup*******i** sila anong mukha ninyong magharap sa amin ng ganun now the franchise is up for renewal you ask me if i object yes i will object unanguna 'yung utang nila anuhin tablahin natin 'yan so how much money hanggang ngayon hindi natin alam wala 'yung record hindi namin mahanap so saan ako during the campaign because iwala naman akong pera may mga taong nagbigay sa akin when already i was up in the ratings nagdikit ako sa so money was already available and on the last week i had to pay that million magbayad ako may pera na eh 'yung ano ko na lang advertisement ko during the presidential debates every intermission makita mo 'yang on the side may mga may mga advertisement ako wala wala man akong pera pero nagkapera ako sabi ko meron akong ano alam mong ginawa ng kababuyan nitong abscbn inuna pa nila 'yung black propaganda ni trillanes na may mga bata ginamit which is prohibited by law you cannot use children there was this injunction and yet abscbn proceeded to air it ang akin wala marami man kami chiz escudero ako and maraming inotso ng abscbn ito kasing mga mayaman if you are small you commit crime you go to jail sa sigarilyo kaya sabi ko vista kaibigan ko 'yun and he offered to pay to file plunder charges against you and you will rot in prison i will see to it that so sabi how much i don't know about dominguez he's the one he's the one computing for the government you ask him ang dominguez nam thirtyseven billion ah bayad siya and of course you have this ayaw ko na lang kasi kaibigan na kami i mean we decided to let things be bygones be bygones but just to mention it ilang presidente dumaan ng pilipinas who was able to collect billion 'yan talagang i'll give you one example if you are connected with the company just let it pass itong line ng cellphone 'yung linyalinya man 'yang level parang air mga air ano tao i'm not a technical person pero it is given by the government free if you intend to build puro corruption pa rin 'yan there's no such thing as given bigyan ka niyan in the law it's free tapos magtayo ka anong tawag doon ah bandwidth binili ito w ibibigay lang talaga 'yan libre eh but somebody bought it here comes now the third i've been insisting on the third so that hanggang ngayon wala pang nangyari i have secretary rio who would fast track it tapos 'yun na favoringfavoring ganun sabi ko in a cabinet meeting kami sabi ko sige na kasi nagtatanong na in the hands of other persons the one that's with him has it been used no hinahawakan lang tapos the other one binili nila oh 'di sabi ko ibigay mo na 'yan doon sa ano sabi nila mayor ayaw isauli because they acquired it ah p***** i** tapos magbayad daw ako talalang tawagan mo lang npa laughter ten percent per tower tumba lahat p***** i** one billion igit mo l**** ka mga mayaman hindi naman itong soldiers to bring along things that belonging to the countries that they ou got it at the expense of the lives of so many innocent people and children you do not return the bell i will sabi niya na in the far and wide in between the years for the demand for their return kung governmentgovernment lang pero ang sabi ko cia ang cia ang laughter pa itong drugs ho i am now in a quandary you know drugs you might find me sometimes repugnant or repulsive but alam mo hindi ako sabi ko hindi ako nagyayabang ayaw mong mamatay huwag kang pumasok dito doon ka na lang sa o diyan ka be a listener there mahirap itong drugs kaya sabi ko i could not have made it more clearer if you destroy my country i will kill you if you make my children eat drugs use drugs and not make it more clearer to everybody to the human rights listen very carefully destroy my country i will kill you destroy our children i will kill you period no apologies no explanation no nothing i have said laid down the rules alam mo hindi lang ninyo alam sabi nila is the predicate of my discussion how narinig ninyo sa past administration even lining up none and when i not only them lahat naman but what is really obnoxious is they belong to the law enforcement ngayon pagsabi ko ito because nakita ko niyang surrender in hours hundreds then by the thousands at the end of the day the count of bato was ang count ni santiago was million at that time both of them are correct iloilo madam mga seven now i have million filipinos who are already slaves who cannot work anymore but lie there in a corner and when the monkey rides on the back they go out sell everything including their children the flesh of their unggoy eh talagang nag wala silang makita they kill especially the young people ayaw lang nang maniwala nitong mga human rights that they are really capable of killing how much ilang police ang nawala sa akin almost na pinatay ng mga durugista and you think of the itong sige magsabi thousand well in a way not then why would i worry with the son of a b**** there lying dead with a pool of blood when i think of the so many filipinos who are already ito this is the head of the family if he is hit then the wife will be in intended for food on the table is gone money little money intended for mga because ito wala na if he becomes dysfunctional the family if you have a friend or enemy gusto mong sirain bigyan mo ang anak ng shabu at makita ninyo and how many are those kasi ang shabu mahirap they are selling forever at you make it easy mga human right as if it is just an ordinary epidemic worse pagkatapos niyan lango na ang mgathey rape a family kill the

shabu shrinks the brain if your brain has pahirapan mo ang tao so people students workers at night could no longer use these public streets publpaguwi passage among the dito sa mga squatters mga mo shabu is the commodity of the poor the rich idiots are on cocaine well ang mayaman mas mabuti because they come from a plant called poppy so it is not as toxic as itong shabu na chemical na para sa patay paghaluin nila sa ecstasy family man but you must consider that this is an issue of public interest i have to let it out in the open she has been using unfortunately the week before she was using ecstacy and she just dropped parang comatose pero umulit pa rin eh peer pressure talaga iyong colombia is still suffering no matter how many thousands of dollars have been poured in to correct an aberration in society until now britain america nagcontribute na you will make it hard now you do it in the ilagay mo na lang ang contamination diyan mga wala na talaga sabi ko the next president must be grappling with this issue ako if i cannot stop it during my term then i would even consider myself not a good public employee kaya sabi ko sa iba sabi ko sa military pati police t*** i** tapusin na natin ito during my term if i have to kill all of them i will kill all of them you know the presidency is a gift from god considering my circumstance when i won it you would hardly believe that i really won it fair and square so my gift to you and to your children is i will try my very best to wipe them from the face of the earth even applause even if i have to go to prison there is no perfect world here so you do you pay as a matter of fact i attempted twice so what do i ask in return nothing because i know that joining public service many many years ago i learned from my father who was governor of davao isa lang ang davao noon eh davao now comprises several local government units davao city that is how big actually my father said you know when you go public if you work for the government you are a worker of government and with it goes the kung anong mangyari sa iyo kaya kung alangan ka takot kang mamatay takot kang maambush ayaw pumasok diyan find then another vocation but i chose because i think work all these years before i became mayor in so hiningi ko eh return do not expect it when you are no longer there people would not rizal but then i have to call back the spaniards to do their thing here again laughter iyan ang so that is mdestroy our society or will make it difficult for us to live normally and so we and plaza or where they want to go return to the filipino people the right to go about anywhere ret na pumunta sila ng mga scenic without their heads being decapitated problems of the mi which is territorial in nature maybe when nur comes back we
